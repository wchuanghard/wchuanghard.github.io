<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3">The first Aleks Initial Knowledge Check I did on Jan 14, 2023. It took about 2 hours while I was also learning and using Mathematica language on its cloud computing engine as a calculator. The system ended the check before I could answer all questions. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3">The first Aleks Initial Knowledge Check I did on March 01, 2023. It only took less than 1 hour this time, and this time I did it manually with I-84 for a few logarithm calculations. This time it was stopped while I could answer all questions. It seems like either it is a system glitch, or it is desinged in a way that the test will be terminated once a test taker reaches 98 percent. Both tests did not give a feedback to the test taker, so I did not know if I missed any points. For this initial knowledge check, I only need to look up the meaning of some descriptions that I have not seen before such as round your result to the nearest hundredth, and annual interest rate compounded quarterly.</font></p>
