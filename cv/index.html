"This course is aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, and is inspired by a
book by the same title, written by Padmanabhan.... While the problems introduce various subjects in
Astrophysics and Cosmology, they do not serve as replacement for standard courses in these subjects, and
are rather aimed at educating students with hands-on analytic/numerical skills to attack new problems."<br><br>
