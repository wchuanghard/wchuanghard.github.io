<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/B99602056.pdf">A ranking report which showed my ranking at NTU was improved from 26 out of 47 to 16 out of 51</a>, though it wasn't a fair ranking because I solely took classes in the physics graduate program (where students' GPAs were largely curved to some extreme, especially for several core courses I took, e.g. applied math III, statistical mechanics II, quantum mechanics I and II, quantum field theory II, etc). It actually only ranked all undergrad students of the class B99 who were assigned to major in bioengineering systems, rather than the whole class of grad students majoring in physics or taking courses in the physics graduate program.</font></p><br>

If one was born in Taiwan, one may have wished since infancy to be able to join the world and be a part of it (for example, to obtain a passport that allows one to access UN facilities like other global citizens). 
</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Furthermore, as someone who has wanted to study mathematical physics and theoretical physics since childhood, I would like to learn from the best of the best in these research fields, and I believe the closest places I could possibly have in Taiwan at the time are mostly in Taipei (e.g. NTU and Academia Sinica) or Hsinchu (e.g. NTHU). I'd like to learn all that undergraduate and graduate students studying mathematical/theoretical physics would learn at such institutions. 
</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
However, I did not begin studying hard on what would be actually evaluated until much later. I was in the bottom 5% of my junior high school class when I started at St. Ignatius high. I decided to go to that school after reading biographies of Ignatius of Loyola and Fr. Beda Chang SJ and influenced by several of my family friends, after 1955 Bishops, priests, and laypeople were imprisoned en masse in Shanghai. Following that, religious people like Fr. Augustine Tsang, S.J., Bosco Lu Ta-ch'eng, S.J. and several others who had been evacuated from China and briefly stayed in the Philippines returned to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau to continue their missionary effort so that after the reform and opening-up, around 1997, several of them, e.g. Fr. Gutheinz Luis, SJ, Bosco Lu Ta-ch'eng, S.J., and my father could visit China and continue the work. Hence, I decided to go to that Jesuit's high school to learn more about their missionary efforts around the world. Thus, in the beginning, I didn't set to study hard as my first priority, but anyways, eventually I did my best to improve my grades and graduated from St. Ignatius high school in the top 3%.
</font></p>


<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
One more thing I think it is worth addressing is that why I was not a good test taker before I went to study in universities is that back then I was in an extreme to reinvent everything. In brief, I refused to read any hints or solutions including the main contents of every textbook, because I was similar to some idealists that I believed if one could not generate a solution of a problem without any helps, then one should not use it. This also reflects an idealists' worry that if given the same conditions, could one also develop the whole theory or the research field like the pioneers did. Because each theorem or proposition was also a problem back when the theory was established. 
<br>
Then, each definition or terminology was also based on an observation of something, so one must be able to generate that something so that one could coin a phrase to describe it.
Hence, if students are not supposed to read solutions, then if one keeps pushing the same logic, a natural result is that students are not supposed to read the contents of textbooks before they invent those contents on their own.
<br>
However, in reality, one does not have decades to reconstruct a subject or a condensed description of it, i.e. a textbook, in limited time before one has to take an exam to perform one's understanding of the subject. If one does not perform well in an important exam, then one may not have that approval to enjoy the process of reinventing the wheels in a longer period of time. 
<br>
If one cannot solve a problem before an exam, one may still be able to solve another problem that is testing the same notion or a similar problem as long as one can recognize that notion and bring that understanding into the exam. This understanding could be based on solutions or proofs written by others. A difference between taking an exam and preparing an exam (say working on exercises) is that each exam is set to at most several hours. But, there are weeks to months for working on exercises. If others did what I did when I was a high school student, then one would use almost most of one's time to figure out a small fraction of contents on the textbooks, and one can bring very little in one's brain while taking the important exam.
<br>
To be successful in an important exam, one is expected to bring an expert brain into the exam. Then, it is more efficient to systematically absorb as many contents as possible with some minimal requirements that one must be able to reconstruct those contents, and be able to apply them in a synthesized way, i.e. apply them as examples, propositions, or theorems. 
<br>
On the other hand, each exercise or problem has a role to help one to discover one's knowledge gap. A good example or exercise with a solution or hint given could save a student's time. Sometimes a small boost could change a person's life, since the result can vary from pass or fail an entrance exam. It could slow down the growth speed of a student by not allowing one to learn from others', or a researcher could slow down the pace of oneself if one is refusing to learn other people's work (since attending conferences might be viewed as reading the solutions for a researcher).
<br>
Hence, I started to allow myself to read the contents of textbooks. My main goal was to avoid not knowing old tricks and making avoidable mistakes, plus learning the history and let them become my experiences, propositions, or examples. 
</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
After I went to NDHU, I started to improve my test taking skills and eventually ranked at around 1.82% when I was at NDHU and be able to transfer to NTU (after passing NTU transfer exams with an acceptance rate fluctuating from 0 to 5% back then) and started to work my way out of the bottom 5% at NTU until I got A's in particle physics, quantum field theory, and advanced field theory courses. 
</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
With the same principle, to learn from the best of the best, I decided to drop out of the education system in Taiwan, and move to the US to start over. The decision made after all my best friends in physics who I took physics courses with in Taiwan, particularly theoretical physics, were either got an offer to become a professor (and very soon a distinguished chair professor), or got offers from good PhD programs in the US from top 1 to top 10, and became professors or post-docs in the US in some top 30 universities now.<br>
I only applied to one school since, as an undergrad, I had an adviser and had attended his research working group meetings for three years and still had a research project to work on at that time. 
<br>
Because I only took graduate-level physics classes, completing my undergraduate degree at NTU would take another three years. As a result, I believe the reason I was put on the <a href="/files/ntu-phys-2013.png"> waitlist</a> was that I did not have an undergraduate degree at the time. Furthermore, after reviewing the application results, I was told that the admission committee was most concerned with my quantum mechanics scores, which were B+ rather than A. In the same semester, I took QFT and received an A. If my memory serves me correctly, just two pupils received As. The other student who received an A already became the outstanding chair professor (at that time, he was a PhD candidate).
<br>
Students who received As one year and two years before my class went on to become assistant professors at Stony Brook and the University of Utah recently. The most significant courses for study are quantum field theory and general relativity in that research field. General physics is rendered worthless, and QFT takes on that job. As a result, after attending NTU, I did not spend much time researching problem-solving techniques one better need to be familiar with in solving problems in general physics in a limited time exam. 
<br>
From a research standpoint, (I was told that) everything beneath QFT is useless; QFT becomes the most fundamental course in theoretical higher energy physics. However, for graduate school entrance, QM carries greater weight. Not to add that the majority of the committee members were experimenters. However, I did not realize this before applying, therefore I did not devote much effort to studying QM at NTU. The majority of my time was spent studying QFT (not an easy subject; some PhD candidates had final letter grades below E, it was a course mostly for PhD candidates, few undergrad there, and all of those undergrads I knew already got their PhD from programs such as MIT, UC  Berkeley, and Caltech), GR, and research literature published in the last 50 years.
<br>
In contrast to those successful NTU people, it was only when I came to NTU that I began to learn how to utilize English for thought and learning. Since the majority of these accomplished NTU graduates were either born in an English-speaking nation or attended American-style schools in Taiwan, they were able to speak English at a native speaker's level or very nearly so.<br>

In addition, their parents could have a PhD in math or physics from a top 30 institution in the United States. If one could not think in English and utilize it without feeling uncomfortable, one would not be able to acquire new things as quickly and easily as native speakers. Not to add that English is the primary language utilized in academics, particularly in STEM research areas. However, my parents and the folks at the schools I attended before going to NTU never took English for granted. All of the things were beyond my control, yet the environment blamed me if I couldn't be like them.
<br>
To avoid unnecessary retaliations (since a large chunk of the population in Taiwan and USA would consider anyone who thinks critically or independently as their threat), I did not want to take any recommendation letters from professors in the universities I went to in Taiwan, though I got about 50 As from them. I didn't want my past to have an impact on my future, therefore I would want to explore what type of life objectives I could reach and how far I could go if I was also born in an English-speaking nation.
<br>
People in Taiwan believe that even a homeless person on the street in the United States can speak and understand English better than the typical English instructor in Taiwan. What I could do was analyze what I had and what I could do with it. As a result, I chose to drop out of Taiwan's educational system and go to the United States to start anew. I'd like to start a new life in the United States, reincarnated as an average American, with limited resources. As a result, I opted to transfer to a community college, which I knew I could do without requesting a reference letter.
<br>
Inspired by this old saying, even a homeless person could teach a lot, e.g. to survive in the US, not to mention a community college that most police officers or a large portion of people who serve in citizen corps or national guards. Motivated by this proverb, "Even a homeless person could teach a lot," such as how to survive in the United States, not to mention that most police officers, national guard members, members of community watching groups or citizen corps attend community colleges. I would like to learn from the best, and I believe native speakers who went or taught at community colleges could speak better English than any average English class in Taiwan.
<br>
What I wasn't sure about was if I could transfer to a reputable institution if I already had 130 semester credits from NTU. Since NTU (and any Taiwanese institution) allows students two years of leave for absence (exceeding that limit may result in dismissal), my first aim after transferring to a community college was to see if I could transfer to a decent four-year university.
<br>
Some may believe that transferring to a California community college from NTU is silly and idiotic. They may claim that, while NTU is not very good, its rating is adequate, since it just dropped out of the top 20 in Asia, and its physics global ranking is 117, according to US News. Given my medical condition, I was unable to serve in the military. Then, as a non-military individual, there is no use in remaining on that island other than being a hostage or liability if any attack on democracy, freedom, and the rule of law occurs on that Pacific island. This does not contradict anything I have learned over the previous decade in the United States.
<br>
My community educator told me that the people of Taiwan served as human shields for the United States. I believe there must be a better solution than merely becoming a human shield passively. Ukraine is another similar example.
<br>
USF is in the semester system, and De Anza is in the quarter system. Hence, when I got admitted to attend USF in Spring 2015, I had to withdraw courses I was taking at that time in De Anza. Since as an F-1 student, I couldn't enroll in both I-20 required programs.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/CCC.pdf">My transcripts from De Anza College (2014 Fall, GPA 4.0/4.0) and Santa Barbara City College (2014 from June to July, GPA 4.0/4.0).</a></font></p>
<br> 



<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
For the same reason, i.e. based on Charles Tiebout's suggestion that people "vote with their feet", I transferred again to USF, a university in the United States in Silicon Valley, in order to have opportunities to study from the best of the best on the planet and start a new family in this country so that my kids do not need to go through the same struggles.

About my PhD applications, in addition to the University of Arizona, I also very appreciated the following programs that accepted my applications (they all inlude a full waiver of tuition with a TA-ship):

<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/UH.pdf">(i) University of Hawaii Mānoa. A great place for number theorists. Plus, recently, they just got Hamilton to join their faculty.</a>  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Chuang.pdf">(ii) University of Arkansas. It is also a very strong program for geometry and topology, and algebra. Furthermore, the University of Arkansas engraved all of the names of their alumni - it is a concrete proof of the university's commitment to students.</a>  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Ohio.pdf">(iii) Ohio University. I applied to this university mostly because of its history. This university started almost at the same time this country was established. Furthermore, one of their faculty is one of Stein's collaborators.</a>  </font></p><br>
When applying for grad programs, among several factors, one important factor that people usually forget is that don't forget to check if you will be happy to study in that environment. Definitely don't forget to check if one would be treated with respect in that university.
Applyng to a PhD program could be challenging sometimes, in particular for international students.<font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Dr.Yin.pdf">(I saw data from Dr. Yin that the acceptance rate in his program for international students is about 5 percent.)</a>  </font></p><br>  
Once again, I really appreciated everyone who helped me to apply.

My family history and genealogy
</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
According to statistics from the US Census Bureau, there are an estimated 2,931 persons in the US with the last name Chuang. This places them 11,621st overall, and their prevalence is 0.92 per 100,000 people. In eastern Asia, Chuang is still a rare surname. The last name is not very common, ranking 323rd in the Song version of "Hundred Surnames," therefore most individuals with this last name are not familiar with their family history up to the third generations before them and may even think they are aliens. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Less than 50,000 persons, or roughly 0.06% of the total population, had the surname Chuang during the Song Dynasty. Fujian had the highest number of Chuangs living there at the time. There were around 120,000 people with the surname Chuang during the Ming Dynasty which is roughly 0.12% of the total population. Guangdong, Fujian, Taiwan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shanghai, and Liaoning are the biggest concentrations.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
My mother was born in Wucuo, which is now known as Erlun in Yunlin County, while my father was born at Erlin Township, also known as Gielem (a deer-rich region) by the Dutch. I was born in New Taipei City, Taiwan, in 1988, and based on my grandparents' family tree, I am the 20th generation to bear the surname Chuang since the first generation of the Chuang family immigrated to Taiwan in the 1600s following the Dutch settlement of Taiwan. That reminds me of the original Mayflower passengers, who came to America early. About the same time, my ancestors were among the first people to flee for their freedom from the old world to the new.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Together with Zheng Chenggong, several Chuangs relocated to Taiwan. Two of their family branches, which are somewhat more focused in academia, still reside in China. The first is the Changzhou branch which alludes to one of the key figures in the Qing dynasty who contributed to the founding of the Changzhou School of Academics. The other is the Qingyang branch.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
A total of 125 Juren, including 46 Jinshi that were uncommon in history, were members of the Changzhou branch, e.g. seven generations and nineteen jinshies, three jinshies that were included on the same list, three generations and eight jinshies, and so on. Prior to some of their family members relocating to Hong Kong and Taiwan, the Qingyang branch also had a nice imperial examination success rate in addition to the Changzhou branch. In the Ming dynasty, this branch of Chuang also produced 19 Jurens and 15 Jinshies.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Yunkuan Chuang (Zhuang Yunkuan), a recent celebrity from the Chuang family. He was a Qing dynasty and Republic of China politician as well as a Chinese calligrapher. He was also a delegate to the conference to create a provisional constitution for the Republic of China. In 1925, he served on the board of directors for the National Palace Museum.
