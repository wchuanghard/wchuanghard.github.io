<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/B99602056.pdf">A ranking report which showed my ranking at NTU was improved from 26 out of 47 to 16 out of 51</a>, though it wasn't a fair ranking because I solely took classes in the physics graduate program (where the final GPAs were largely curved, especially for several core courses I took, e.g. applied math III, statistical machenics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, etc). It actually only ranked all undergrad students of the class B99 who were assigned to major in bioengineering systems, rather than the whole class of grad students majoring in physics or taking courses in the physics graduate program.</font></p><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/IMG_8624.pdf">In order to gather views and visions for a presidential election, the former president of Taiwan (2008-2016), the mayor of Taipei City (1998-2006), and the former justice minister of Taiwan met with the students of the NDHU Academic Excellence Award (i.e. Dean's List Award).</a>  </font></p><br>

If one was born in Taiwan, one may have wished since infancy to be able to join the world and be a part of it (for example, to obtain a passport that allows one to access UN facilities like other global citizens). 
</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Furthermore, as someone who has wanted to study mathematical physics and theoretical physics since childhood, I would like to learn from the best of the best in these research fields, and I believe the closest places I could possibly have in Taiwan at the time are mostly in Taipei (e.g. NTU and Academia Sinica) or Hsinchu (e.g. NTHU). I'd like to learn all that undergraduate and graduate students studying mathematical/theoretical physics would learn at such institutions.

However, I did not begin studying hard on what would be actually evaluated until much later. I was in the bottom 5% of my junior high school class when I started at St. Ignatius high. I decided to go to that school after reading biographies of Ignatius of Loyola and Fr. Beda Chang SJ and influenced by several of my family friends, after 1955 Bishops, priests, and laypeople were imprisoned en masse in Shanghai. Following that, religious people like Fr. Augustine Tsang, S.J., Bosco Lu Ta-ch'eng, S.J. and several others who had been evacuated from China and briefly stayed in the Philippines returned to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau to continue their missionary effort so that after the reform and opening-up, around 1997, several of them, e.g. Fr. Gutheinz Luis, SJ, Bosco Lu Ta-ch'eng, S.J., and my father could visit China and continue the work. Hence, I decided to go to that Jesuit's high school to learn more about their missionary efforts around the world. Thus, in the beginning, I didn't set to study hard as my first priority, but anyways, eventually I did my best to improve my grades and graduated from St. Ignatius high school in the top 3%.

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
After I went to NDHU, I started to improve my test taking skills and eventually ranked at around 1.82% when I was at NDHU and be able to transfer to NTU (after passing NTU transfer exams with an acceptance rate fluctuating from 0 to 5% back then) and started to work my way out of the bottom 5% at NTU until I got A's in particle physics, quantum field theory, and advanced field theory courses.

For the same reason, I transferred again to USF, a university in the United States in Silicon Valley, in order to have opportunities to study from the best of the best on the planet and start a new family in this country so that my kids do not need to go through the same struggles.

About my PhD applications, in addition to the University of Arizona, I also very appreciated the following programs that accepted my applications (they all inlude a full waiver of tuition with a TA-ship):

<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/UH.pdf">(i) University of Hawaii Mānoa. A great place for number theorists. Plus, recently, they just got Hamilton to join their faculty.</a>  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Chuang.pdf">(ii) University of Arkansas. It is also a very strong program for geometry and topology, and algebra. Furthermore, the University of Arkansas engraved all of the names of their alumni - it is a concrete proof of the university's commitment to students.</a>  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Ohio.pdf">(iii) Ohio University. I applied to this university mostly because of its history. This university started almost at the same time this country was established. Furthermore, one of their faculty is one of Stein's collaborators.</a>  </font></p><br>
When applying for grad programs, among several factors, one important factor that people usually forget is that don't forget to check if you will be happy to study in that environment. Definitely don't forget to check if one would be treated with respect in that university.
Applyng to a PhD program could be challenging sometimes, in particular for international students.<font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Dr.Yin.pdf">(I saw data from Dr. Yin that the acceptance rate in his program for international students is about 5 percent.)</a>  </font></p><br>  
Once again, I really appreciated everyone who helped me to apply.

My family history and genealogy
</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
According to statistics from the US Census Bureau, there are an estimated 2,931 persons in the US with the last name Chuang. This places them 11,621st overall, and their prevalence is 0.92 per 100,000 people. In eastern Asia, Chuang is still a rare surname. The last name is not very common, ranking 323rd in the Song version of "Hundred Surnames," therefore most individuals with this last name are not familiar with their family history up to the third generations before them and may even think they are aliens. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Less than 50,000 persons, or roughly 0.06% of the total population, had the surname Chuang during the Song Dynasty. Fujian had the highest number of Chuangs living there at the time. There were around 120,000 people with the surname Chuang during the Ming Dynasty which is roughly 0.12% of the total population. Guangdong, Fujian, Taiwan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shanghai, and Liaoning are the biggest concentrations.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
My mother was born in Wucuo, which is now known as Erlun in Yunlin County, while my father was born at Erlin Township, also known as Gielem (a deer-rich region) by the Dutch. I was born in New Taipei City, Taiwan, in 1988, and based on my grandparents' family tree, I am the 20th generation to bear the surname Chuang since the first generation of the Chuang family immigrated to Taiwan in the 1600s following the Dutch settlement of Taiwan. That reminds me of the original Mayflower passengers, who came to America early. About the same time, my ancestors were among the first people to flee for their freedom from the old world to the new.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Together with Zheng Chenggong, several Chuangs relocated to Taiwan. Two of their family branches, which are somewhat more focused in academia, still reside in China. The first is the Changzhou branch which alludes to one of the key figures in the Qing dynasty who contributed to the founding of the Changzhou School of Academics. The other is the Qingyang branch.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
A total of 125 Juren, including 46 Jinshi that were uncommon in history, were members of the Changzhou branch, e.g. seven generations and nineteen jinshies, three jinshies that were included on the same list, three generations and eight jinshies, and so on. Prior to some of their family members relocating to Hong Kong and Taiwan, the Qingyang branch also had a nice imperial examination success rate in addition to the Changzhou branch. In the Ming dynasty, this branch of Chuang also produced 19 Jurens and 15 Jinshies.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Yunkuan Chuang (Zhuang Yunkuan), a recent celebrity from the Chuang family. He was a Qing dynasty and Republic of China politician as well as a Chinese calligrapher. He was also a delegate to the conference to create a provisional constitution for the Republic of China. In 1925, he served on the board of directors for the National Palace Museum.
