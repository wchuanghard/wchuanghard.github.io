About my PhD applications, in addition to the University of Arizona, I also very appreciated the following programs that accepted my applications (they all inlude a full waiver of tuition with a TA-ship):

<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/UH.pdf">(i) University of Hawaii Mānoa. A great place for number theorists. Plus, recently, they just got Hamilton to join their faculty.</a>  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Chuang.pdf">(ii) University of Arkansas. It is also a very strong program for geometry and topology, and algebra. Furthermore, the University of Arkansas engraved all of the names of their alumni - it is a concrete proof of the university's commitment to students.</a>  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Ohio.pdf">(iii) Ohio University. I applied to this university mostly because of its history. This university started almost at the same time this country was established. Furthermore, one of their faculty is one of Stein's collaborators.</a>  </font></p><br>
When applying for grad programs, among several factors, one important factor that people usually forget is that don't forget to check if you will be happy to study in that environment. Definitely don't forget to check if one would be treated with respect in that university.
Applyng to a PhD program could be challenging sometimes, in particular for international students.<font size="3"> <a href="/files/PhD_applications/Dr.Yin.pdf">(I saw data from Dr. Yin that the acceptance rate in his program for international students is about 5 percent.)</a>  </font></p><br>  
Once again, I really appreciated everyone who helped me to apply.

My family history and genealogy
</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
According to statistics from the US Census Bureau, there are an estimated 2,931 persons in the US with the last name Chuang. This places them 11,621st overall, and their prevalence is 0.92 per 100,000 people. In eastern Asia, Chuang is still a rare surname. The last name is not very common, ranking 323rd in the Song version of "Hundred Surnames," therefore most individuals with this last name are not familiar with their family history up to the third generations before them and may even think they are aliens. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Less than 50,000 persons, or roughly 0.06% of the total population, had the surname Chuang during the Song Dynasty. Fujian had the highest number of Chuangs living there at the time. There were around 120,000 people with the surname Chuang during the Ming Dynasty which is roughly 0.12% of the total population. Guangdong, Fujian, Taiwan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shanghai, and Liaoning are the biggest concentrations.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
My mother was born in Wucuo, which is now known as Erlun in Yunlin County, while my father was born at Erlin Township, also known as Gielem (a deer-rich region) by the Dutch. I was born in New Taipei City, Taiwan, in 1988, and based on my grandparents' family tree, I am the 20th generation to bear the surname Chuang since the first generation of the Chuang family immigrated to Taiwan in the 1600s following the Dutch settlement of Taiwan. That reminds me of the original Mayflower passengers, who came to America early. About the same time, my ancestors were among the first people to flee for their freedom from the old world to the new.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Together with Zheng Chenggong, several Chuangs relocated to Taiwan. Two of their family branches, which are somewhat more focused in academia, still reside in China. The first is the Changzhou branch which alludes to one of the key figures in the Qing dynasty who contributed to the founding of the Changzhou School of Academics. The other is the Qingyang branch.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
A total of 125 Juren, including 46 Jinshi that were uncommon in history, were members of the Changzhou branch, e.g. seven generations and nineteen jinshies, three jinshies that were included on the same list, three generations and eight jinshies, and so on. Prior to some of their family members relocating to Hong Kong and Taiwan, the Qingyang branch also had a nice imperial examination success rate in addition to the Changzhou branch. In the Ming dynasty, this branch of Chuang also produced 19 Jurens and 15 Jinshies.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><font size="3">
Yunkuan Chuang (Zhuang Yunkuan), a recent celebrity from the Chuang family. He was a Qing dynasty and Republic of China politician as well as a Chinese calligrapher. He was also a delegate to the conference to create a provisional constitution for the Republic of China. In 1925, he served on the board of directors for the National Palace Museum.
